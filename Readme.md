# Naive Chess Implementation
This is a naive 2d-array based implemenation of chess. It exists just for some stress free, zero overthinking practice of Go, so the code is not properly structured and there is not much adherence to Clean Code principles or performance oriented programming.

There is also no guarantee that all rules of chess are implemented without errors.

Good luck!
